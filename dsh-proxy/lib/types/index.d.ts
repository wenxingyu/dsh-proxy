/**
 * dsh-proxy host plugin: mounts the authenticated LAN reverse proxy on a
 * second port, forwarding the web app's loopback listener (127.0.0.1:3080 by
 * default) to the LAN with a web-based login gate. The harness deliberately
 * refuses `--host 0.0.0.0` for the web server itself — remote code execution
 * exposure — so this plugin is the sanctioned way to serve the surface beyond
 * loopback, with authentication in front.
 *
 * The plugin also mounts the `/dsh-proxy` generic Connection RPC channel:
 * `status` reads the running proxy, `update` persists a settings patch (target
 * upstream port, username, password) into `$DSH_HOME/dsh-proxy.json` and
 * restarts the forwarding service — the backend of the settings section.
